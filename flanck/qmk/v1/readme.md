Flanck is the "Fat Planck". It is a low profile 4x12 grid style keypoard using Kailh Choc Switch. The outer most columns are modified to be 1.5U wide to make it easier to hit without stretching the wrist too much. The two sides are also made 1U apart to make it more ergonomic. It also makes room for the Elite-C on the top side of the PCB, which allows us to reduce the height of the board.
